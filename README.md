You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.

As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

It’s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.

Deep at the center of my being is an infinite well of love.

I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.
